# Tampering

This example demonstrates tampering through script injection.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Install all dependencies

    `npm install`

2. Start the **insecure.ts** server

    `npx ts-node insecure.ts`

3. In the browser, type a potentially malicious script in the name field of the form

    ```
        <script> document.body.innerHTML = "<a href='https://google.com'> Gotcha </a>"</script>
    ```

4. Do you see the potentially malicious hyperlink being injected into the form?

## For you to do

Answer the following:

1. Briefly explain the potential vulnerabilities in **insecure.ts**
2. Briefly explain how a malicious attacker can exploit them.
3. Briefly explain why **secure.ts** does not have the same vulnerabilties?


1. Insecure.ts does not check any of the input, which is used directly to set the session user.
2. if the input has html special characters, it can be used to insert and run it's own code code.
3. secure.ts does not have the same vulnerabilities because is cleans the input string to remove potential html special characters escaped.
