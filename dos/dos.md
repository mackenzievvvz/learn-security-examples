# Denial-of-Service (DoS)

This example demonstrates DoS vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Install all dependencies

    `$ npm install`

2. Ignore if you have already done this once. Insert test data in the MongoDB database. Make sure the mongod is up and running by typing the `mongosh` command in the termainal. If mongod process is up then you will see that the connection was successful. Command to insert test data:

    `$ npx ts-node insert-test-users.ts`

This will create a database in MongoDB called __infodisclosure__. Verify its presence by connecting with mongosh and running the command `show dbs;`.

2. Start the **insecure.ts** server

    `$ npx ts-node insecure.ts`

3. In the browser, pretend to be a hacker and type a malicious request

    ```
        http://localhost:3000/userinfo?id[$ne]=
    ```

4. Do you see the server crashing?

## For you to do

Answer the following:

1. Briefly explain the potential vulnerabilities in **insecure.ts** that can lead to a DoS attack.
2. Briefly explain how a malicious attacker can exploit them.
3. Briefly explain the defensive techniques used in **secure.ts** to prevent the DoS vulnerability?

1. in insecure.ts, there is no limit to the number of requests one client can make.
2. a malicious attacker can overload the server by sending more requests than it can handle at once, or sending so many requests that it cannot handle other client's requests well.
3. secure.ts uses a rate limiter to ensure that each client can only send one request per 5 second window.
